# Building a URL Shortener with Node.js, React, and MongoDB

This project demonstrates how to build a URL shortener using Node.js, React, and MongoDB. The application allows users to create shortened URLs that redirect to the original URL. It also tracks the number of visits to each shortened URL.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a backend API and a frontend web application.

### Backend

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides the following functionalities:

-   User authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
-   URL shortening using a random string of characters
-   Visit count tracking for shortened URLs
-   CRUD operations for URLs
-   Exporting URL history to an Excel sheet

The backend API is secured using CORS and rate limiting is implemented using Express Rate Limit.

### Frontend

The frontend is built using React and Bootstrap. It provides the following functionalities:

-   User registration and login
-   URL shortening form
-   Displaying all shortened URLs generated by a user
-   Exporting URL history to an Excel sheet
-   Deleting shortened URLs
-   Navigation using react-router-dom
-   Integration with the backend API with Axios
